# JavaLexCounter

I donâ€™t know how it brought you here.
This is my lab on Programming Languages and Translation Methods.
This program is a lexical analyzer of the Java programming language. Old school Java.
The lexical analyzer relies on "The Java Language Specification" James Gosling, Bill Joy, Guy Steele Version 1.0
I used c # not as an object oriented language, this is very bad.
Please do not take this project seriously :)
